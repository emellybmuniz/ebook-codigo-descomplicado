Could you create an image for my ebook titled "Código Descomplicado: Domine os Fundamentos Sem Precisar Ser um Gênio!" in pixel art style? I would like a stereotypical mad doctor to satirize the phrase "You don't need to be a genius.

Prompt for the content:
---

I'm developing an educational eBook called "Código Descomplicado: Domine os Fundamentos Sem Precisar Ser um Gênio!" focusing on beginners in programming. I want it to teach programming logic in an accessible, progressive way with technical depth, but without using unnecessary jargon.  

Desired tone and style:  
- Light, simple, clear language, and not childish.  
- Uncomplicated explanations, as if the reader were talking to someone who truly understands the subject, but doesn't want to seem superior.  
- Zero academicism or excessive flair: each page should be useful and with a beginning-middle-end structure.  
- I don't want bullet points in excess — I prefer well-structured paragraphs and integrated examples within the text.  

Book format and structure:  
- Avoid abrupt page breaks.  
- Content follows a logical pedagogical sequence, starting from the mindset of the programmer (chapter 1) and progressing to algorithms, data, variables, operators, etc.  
- Each technical concept is always anchored in practical examples and real-world scenarios, using simple pseudocode, Portuguese, to reinforce learning.  
- Exercises and challenges at the end of pages are welcome but should follow the same logic: syntax first.  

Already developed and established:  
- Introduction: breaks the myth that only geniuses can program, using daily examples to show that everyone uses logic daily.  
- What I am looking for:  
  - Helps with creative expansion of future chapters, keeping the tone accessible and clear.  
  - Creative analogies, exercises well contextualized, and ways to address technical content without sounding dry or robotic.  
  - A writing structure that balances didactics, technical progression, and natural engagement.  

Summary:  
- Technical teaching with a conversational tone. Each line should teach something and motivate the reader.
